name="Easy Savefiles"
description="An easy way to save and load project settings. The plugin provides a simple singleton interface to manage project settings, import or export them to a .cfg file.
As always, some variables should not be tampered with, and will cause the editor to crash, just edit what you know will work... or just make a different project and fuck around, but you know, be careful with your computer â˜»."
